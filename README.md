## How It Works

1. The program starts by asking how many new students to add.
2. For each student, the system will:
   - Prompt for the student's first name, last name, and grade year.
   - Generate a unique student ID.
   - Allow the student to enroll in any number of available courses.
   - Calculate the tuition based on enrolled courses.
   - Enable tuition payment and balance viewing.
   - Display the full status including enrolled courses and pending balance.
